**UPDATED ATTRIBUTION METHODOLOGY:**

1. **Order Filtering**: 
   - ONLY count orders where Order Status = "Completed"
   - Exclude: Cancelled, Unfulfilled, Refund, Refund Disputed

2. **Sales Calculation** (Updated):
   - **Total Sales (Net)**: Use "Sales (excl. tax)" to match merchant portal reporting
   - **Marketing Driven Sales**: Sum "Sales (excl. tax)" for orders with promotional offers
   - **Organic Sales**: Sum "Sales (excl. tax)" for orders without promotional offers

3. **Marketing Investment Components** (Updated):
   - **Ad Spend (All Misc Payments)**: Sum absolute value of ALL "Other payments" where "Other payments description" is not null (includes Ad Spend, Ad Credits, Accelerated Remittance Fees, Reverse charges, etc.)
   - **Offer/Discount Value**: Sum absolute value of all promotional discounts given to customers
   - **Total Marketing Investment**: Ad Spend (All Misc Payments) + Offer/Discount Value

4. **Net Payout Calculation** (Updated):
   - **Net Payout $ (All Statuses)**: Sum ALL "Total payout" values for ALL order statuses (Completed, Refund, Cancelled, Unfulfilled, Refund Disputed)
   - Includes negative payouts for refunds and positive payouts for completed orders

5. **Marketing Attribution**:
   - **Marketing Driven Sales**: Orders with "Offers on items (incl. tax)" < 0 OR "Delivery Offer Redemptions (incl. tax)" < 0
   - **Organic Sales**: All other completed orders without promotional discounts

6. **Key Calculations**:
   - **AOV** = Total Sales (Net) ÷ Total Orders
   - **Marketing ROAS** = Marketing Driven Sales ÷ Total Marketing Investment  
   - **Net Payout %** = (Net Payout $ ÷ Total Sales (Net)) × 100
   - **Offers ROAS** = Sales from offers ÷ Discount value
   - **Combined ROAS** = Sales from offers ÷ (All Misc Payments + Discount value)
   - **Ad Efficiency** = Sales from offers ÷ All Misc Payments

**ANALYSIS REQUIREMENTS:**

- Week Definition: Monday through Sunday of specified week only
- Validation: Ensure Marketing + Organic = Total for both sales and orders
- Performance Rankings: Sort by relevance (sales, efficiency, etc.)
- Insights: Identify optimal marketing mix and efficiency patterns

**KEY CHANGES FROM PREVIOUS VERSION:**
- **Sales**: Now using "Sales (excl. tax)" instead of "Sales (incl. tax)" for merchant portal alignment
- **Ad Spend**: Now includes ALL miscellaneous payments (Ad Spend + Ad Credits + Fees + Reverse Charges) instead of just "Ad Spend"
- **Net Payout**: Now sums ALL "Total payout" across ALL order statuses instead of just completed orders
