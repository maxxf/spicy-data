Menu Summary:
Total Categories: 8 (down from 9)

Total Items: 26

Items with Price Increases: 14

New Items Added: 3

Rationale for Menu Changes
1. Category Restructuring (9→8 Categories)
Consolidated: "Sides" + "Extra Dressing" → "Sides & Add-Ons" (low-volume items grouped)

Renamed: "Extra Protein" → "Power-Ups" (more appealing, suggests enhancement)

Renamed: "Drinks" → "Fuel Up" (aligns with fitness/wellness positioning)

Renamed: "Desserts" → "Sweet Treats" (playful, less guilt-inducing)

Added: "Power Bundles" category (NEW) to highlight meal deals and BOGO

Rationale: 8 categories still optimal. Consolidation reduces clutter while new "Power Bundles" category drives AOV.

2. Pricing Philosophy: Value-Based Pricing
Current state: BO[W]LD is underpriced vs market on premium items (salmon, shrimp, curated bowls)

4.8 rating + fire-grilled differentiation justifies premium positioning

Price increases target premium/specialty items (not entry-level or chicken)

Competitive parity maintained on high-volume items (chicken bowls, add-ons)

3. New Bundle Offerings (3 Added)
Lunch Deal ($20.99): Targets office workers, high-margin combo (bowl+side+drink)

Protein Pack ($25.00): Keeps existing BOGO structure, proven performer

Gym Fuel ($22.99): Targets fitness crowd, pairs protein bowl with premium wellness drink

Rationale: Bundles drive AOV lift (+15-30%) and reduce decision fatigue

4. New "Double Protein" Modifier
Price: $5.99 (same as single extra protein)

Target: High-protein seekers who want 2x their base protein

Rationale: Upsell opportunity for Protein Power buyers, competitive with "extra protein" add-on pricing

5. Premium Protein Price Increases
Salmon bowls: $17.49 → $18.49 (market avg: $20+)

Shrimp bowls: $17.49 → $18.49 (market avg: $21+)

Rationale: Still $2-3 below premium competitors (IQ Food Co, Impact Kitchen), justified by quality

6. Entry-Level Price Adjustments
Green Glow (base bowl): $11.49 → $11.99 (+$0.50)

Rationale: Brings to Freshii parity, still accessible, maintains value perception

7. Premium Beverage Pricing
Wellness shots (kombucha, etc): $4.45 → $5.45 (+$1.00)

Current gap: $2.54 below Freshii's $6.99 smoothies

Rationale: Still $1.50 below market, aligns with premium wellness positioning

8. Low-Volume Item Increases
Sides & dressings: $1.49 → $1.99 (+$0.50)

Rationale: Low attach rate, minimal customer resistance, brings to market parity

9. Items Kept Competitive (No Change)
Fire-Kissed Chicken: $17.49 (highest-volume item, keep competitive)

Tofu/Mushroom bowls: $17.49 (veg options should be accessible)

Extra Chicken Tenders: $5.99 (high-volume add-on)

Premium Toppings: $2.99 (competitive with market)

Desserts: $4.99 (unique "Shockingly Healthy" positioning, OK as-is)

Expected Impact of Optimized Menu
Revenue Lift Projections:

Price increases: +$1.50-2.50 per order = +$750-2,500/month (depending on volume)

New bundles: +$2-4 AOV lift on 20-30% of orders = +$400-1,200/month

Double Protein upsell: 10% attachment rate = +$200-400/month

Total monthly lift: +$1,350-4,100/month (+5-15% revenue increase)

Customer Experience:

✅ Maintains entry-level accessibility ($11.99 base bowl)

✅ Bundles reduce decision fatigue and drive value perception

✅ Premium pricing signals quality (fire-grilled, curated, functional nutrition)

✅ Chicken bowls stay competitive (highest volume item)

Competitive Positioning:

Still below IQ Food Co / Impact Kitchen on premium items ($18.49 vs $20-22)

At parity with Freshii on entry-level items

Best value on shrimp/salmon vs premium competitors
