**UPDATED ATTRIBUTION METHODOLOGY (DOORDASH):**

1. **Order Filtering**
   - ONLY count orders where Channel = "Marketplace" AND Order Status = "Completed"
   - Exclude ALL orders from other channels (Caviar, white-label, etc.)
   - Exclude: Cancelled, Unfulfilled, Refund, Refund Disputed

2. **Sales Calculation (Updated)**
   - **Total Sales (Net):** Use "Sales (excl. tax)" to match DoorDash merchant reporting
   - **Marketing Driven Sales:** Sum "Sales (excl. tax)" for orders with promotional offers
   - **Organic Sales:** Sum "Sales (excl. tax)" for orders without promotional offers

3. **Marketing Investment Components (Updated)**
   - **Ad Spend (All Misc Payments):** Sum absolute value of ALL "Other payments" where "Other payments description" is not null (includes Ad Spend, Ad Credits, Accelerated Remittance Fees, Reverse charges, etc.)
   - **Offer/Discount Value:** Sum absolute value of all promotional discounts given to customers **PLUS any credits applied from "Marketing Credits" and "Third-party Contribution" fields**
   - **Total Marketing Investment:** Ad Spend (All Misc Payments) + Offer/Discount Value

4. **Net Payout Calculation (Updated)**
   - **Net Payout $ (All Statuses):** Sum ALL "Total payout" values for ALL order statuses (Completed, Refund, Cancelled, Unfulfilled, Refund Disputed)
   - Includes negative payouts for refunds and positive payouts for completed orders

5. **Marketing Attribution**
   - **Marketing Driven Sales:** Orders with "Offers on items (incl. tax)" < 0 OR "Delivery Offer Redemptions (incl. tax)" < 0 OR have credits from "Marketing Credits" OR "Third-party Contribution"
   - **Organic Sales:** All other completed orders without promotional discounts, credits, or contributions

6. **Key Calculations**
   - **AOV** = Total Sales (Net) ÷ Total Orders
   - **Marketing ROAS** = Marketing Driven Sales ÷ Total Marketing Investment
   - **Net Payout %** = (Net Payout $ ÷ Total Sales (Net)) × 100
   - **Offers ROAS** = Sales from offers ÷ Discount value
   - **Combined ROAS** = Sales from offers ÷ (All Misc Payments + Discount value)
   - **Ad Efficiency** = Sales from offers ÷ All Misc Payments
